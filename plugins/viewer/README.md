# ssb-viewer

HTTP server for read-only views of SSB content. Serves content as web pages or as scripts for embedding in other web pages.

## Install & Run

As a sbot plugin:
```sh
mkdir -p ~/.ssb/node_modules
cd ~/.ssb/node_modules
git clone ssb://%MeCTQrz9uszf9EZoTnKCeFeIedhnKWuB3JHW2l1g9NA=.sha256 ssb-viewer && cd ssb-viewer
npm install
sbot plugins.enable ssb-viewer
# restart sbot
```

Or standalone:
```sh
git clone ssb://%MeCTQrz9uszf9EZoTnKCeFeIedhnKWuB3JHW2l1g9NA=.sha256 ssb-viewer && cd ssb-viewer
npm install
./bin.js
```

## Usage

To view a thread as a web page, navigate to a url like `http://localhost:8807/%MSGID`.

To embed a thread into another web page, load it as follows:

```html
<script src="http://localhost:8807/%MSGID.js"></script>
```

To add more than the base styles, you can also load `http://localhost:8807/static/nicer.css`.

## Routes

- `/%msgid`: web page showing a message thread
- `/%msgid.js`: script to embed a message thread
- `/%msgid.json`: message thread as JSON
- `/&feedid`: web page showing a complete feed
- `/user-feed/&feedid`: web page showing messages from followed users and channels of a feed
- `/channel/#channel`: web page showing messages in a specific channel

### Query options

- `noroot`: don't include the root message in the thread
- `base=...`: base url for links that ssb-viewer can handle
- `msg_base=...`: base url for links to messages
- `feed_base=...`: base url for links to feeds
- `blob_base=...`: base url for links to blobs
- `img_base=...`: base url for embedded blobs (images)
- `emoji_base=...`: base url for emoji images

The `*_base` query options overwrite the defaults set in the config.
The `base` option is a fallback instead of specifying the URLs separately.
The base options are mostly useful for embedding, where the script is embedded
on a different origin than where ssb-viewer is running. However, you may not
need them, as the ssb-viewer embed script will detect the base where it is
included from.

## Config

To change `ssb-viewer`'s default options, edit your `~/.ssb/config`, to have
properties like the following:
```json
{
  "viewer": {
    "port": 8807,
    "host": "::"
  }
}
```
You can also pass these as command-line options to `./bin.js` or `sbot` as,
e.g. `--viewer.port 8807`.

- `viewer.port`: port for the server to listen on. default: `8807`
- `viewer.host`: host address for the server to listen on. default: `::`
- `viewer.base`: default base url for links that ssb-viewer can handle
- `viewer.msg_base`: base url for links to ssb messages
- `viewer.feed_base`: base url for links to ssb feeds
- `viewer.blob_base`: base url for links to ssb blobs
- `viewer.img_base`: base url for embedded blobs (images)
- `viewer.emoji_base`: base url for emoji images
