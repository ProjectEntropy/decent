# Decent

### A decent(ralized) network for business and development.

In the beginning the web was distributed. Then companies in the valley centralized it for their own profit, impoverishing the creative class of the Internet. We're creating a decent alternative.

Decent is based on [Scuttlebot](http://scuttlebot.io), but uses an alternative network key: `EVRctE2Iv8GrO/BpQCF34e2FMPsDJot9x0j846LjVtc=`.

Decent combines all of the necessary parts of Scuttlebot for a simpler install process

```
% git clone
% npm install
% npm build
% npm start
```

You'll need an invite from a Decent pub to join the network [email me](mailto:ev@evbogue.com), or contact me via a lite client.

You can get free local and lite client invites to Decent [here](http://sdash.evbogue.com/invite/):

Once you're on Decent, be sure to obey the first rule:

1. Be decent

Decent is maintained by [Ev Bogue](http://evbogue.com), based on the work of [Dominic Tarr](http://dominictarr.com).
