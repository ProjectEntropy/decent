# Decent

A decent(ralized) network for business and development.

In the beginning the web was distributed. Then companies in the valley centralized it for their own profit, impoverishing the creative class of the Internet. We're creating a decent alternative.

Decent is based on [Scuttlebot](), but uses an alternative network key to the Scuttlebot network.

The Decent stack is broken up into two parts:

+ Decent client
+ Decent pub

When you run the Decent daemon on a VPS, it's called a Decent pub.

You can get free local and lite client invites to Decent [here](http://sdash.evbogue.com/invite/):

Once you're on Decent, be sure to obey the first rule:

1. Be decent

Decent is maintained by [Ev Bogue](http://evbogue.com), based on the work of [Dominic Tarr](http://dominictarr.com).
